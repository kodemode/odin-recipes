        <h2>when you need that coffee kick</h2>

        <p class="description">Ever wondered what heaven tastes like? If you're like me and enjoy all things iced or coffee-related, rest assured that you will absolutely love this one. This has been my go-to drink for a few years now - no matter the season - and every day I am so thankful that someone had the genius to invent oat milk (<em>which tastes way better than it sounds!</em>).</p>
        <p class ="description">This drink is pretty simple and can be made as sweet (or unsweetened) as you'd like, and has the added benefits of being cruelty-free and more sustainable for the planet.</p>

        <h3>♡ Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="recipeList">
            <li>1-2 espresso shots of coffee made from your favorite beans</li>
            <li>Oat milk of your choice
                <ul>
                    <li>After trying out many different kinds, I recommend <strong>Minor Figures</strong> for the best flavour & creaminess.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
            <li>Natural sweetener (<em>optional</em>)
                <ul>
                    <li>I recommend maple syrup, but usually prefer this drink unsweetened.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Reusable straw (<em>optional</em>)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>♡ Instructions</h3>
        <ol class="recipeList">
            <li>Get a large cup/mug of your choice and prepare 1-2 shots of espresso into it.</li>
            <li>Fill up the cup with ice cubes generously, until they almost reach the top of the cup.</li>
            <li>Add oat milk. Its quantity depends on preference & how many espresso shots you added, but normally the ice cubes <em>shouldn't</em> fully be covered by milk.</li>
            <li>Add natural sweetener of your choice, if desired.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="description">And <em><strong>voila!</strong></em> Enjoy this tasty, quick & easy drink.</p>
