        <h3>♡ Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Ever wondered what heaven tastes like?</strong> If you're like me and enjoy all things iced or coffee-related, rest assured that you will absolutely love this one. This has been my go-to drink for a few years now - no matter the season - and every day I am so thankful that someone had the genius to invent oat milk (<em>which tastes way better than it sounds!</em>).</p>
        <p>This drink is pretty simple and can be made as sweet (or unsweetened) as you'd like, and has the added benefits of being cruelty-free and more sustainable for the planet.</p>

        <h3>♡ Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 espresso shots of coffee</li>
            <li>Oat milk of your choice
                <ul>
                    <li>After trying out many different kinds, I recommend <strong>Minor Figures</strong> for the best flavour & creaminess</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
            <li>Natural sweetener (<em>optional</em>)
                <ul>
                    <li>I recommend maple syrup, but usually prefer this drink unsweetened</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Reusable straw (<em>optional</em>)</li>
        </ul>
