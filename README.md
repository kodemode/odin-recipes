# odin-recipes

In this project, I am building a basic recipes website, consisting of an index page and links to three recipes. This is meant to test and demonstrate my HTML and Git skills learned up until now - namely setting up an HTML boilerplate, making headings, paragraphs, lists, bold/italic text, and adding links & images.
